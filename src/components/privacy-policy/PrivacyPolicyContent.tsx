          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            When you interact with the Company through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. The Company may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Company affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site or App downloads, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors&apos; Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            In operating the Services, we may use a technology called &quot;cookies.&quot; A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a &quot;help&quot; section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.

          <h3 className="text-[18px] font-semibold mb-3">Aggregated Personal Data:</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, the Company often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and the Company may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. The Company may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-[18px] font-semibold mb-3">Log Files:</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            Like many internet and mobile services, we may automatically gather certain information about our Services traffic and store it in log files. This information includes mobile device identifiers, browser type, IP address, mobile or internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Services, to track users&apos; movements around the Services, and to gather demographic information about our user base.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            We also store in our log files information identifying users who have accessed data that we process and store about patients, and any changes they make to such data. We use this information to comply with legal obligations relating to such data and to keep a record of such changes. We may also use it to improve our Services. We may link this automatically collected data to Personal Data. Device identifiers may be tied to Personal Data to troubleshoot access issues.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            We may use third-party tracking services that use log files, cookies, and possibly other techniques to track non-Personal Data about visitors to the Services in the aggregate. These services capture usage and volume statistics as well as geographical location data to compile usage reports and maps for optimization and troubleshooting purposes.
